Coefficient extraction:
=======================

Macros MACROBLK_CUR_DC, MACROBLK_CUR_LP and MACROBLK_CUR_HP (see T.835/jxr_priv.h).
MACROBLK_CUR_DC returns the l-value of the DC coefficient in the macroblock.

MACROBLK_CUR_LP returns the l-value of the LP coefficients in the macroblock.
k can range from 0 to 14 (= 15 LP coefficients).

MACROBLK_CUR_HP returns the l-value of the HP coefficients in the macroblock.
blk can range from 0 to 15 (block identification within the macroblock).
k can range from 0 to 14 (coefficient within the block).
16 * 15 = 240 HP coefficients.

struct jxr_image (see T.835/jxr_priv.h) contains the actual coefficients. Let 'image' be an instantiation of this struct.
While en-/decoding the image the coefficients of the current processed macroblock and the i-th strip are stored in image.strip[i].data.
image.strip[i].data holds 256 coefficients:
 - index 0 represents the DC coefficient (1)
 - indices 1 - 15 represent the LP coefficients (15)
 - indices 16 - 255 represent the HP coefficient (240)

 r_strip.c: in lines 2145 to 2152 the coefficients of a row of macroblocks are printed to stdout at the end of the decode process. Possible coefficient extraction point?!
